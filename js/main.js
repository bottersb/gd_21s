infoBoxExcersise = "<b>Excersise</b><br> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385214/\">Numerous studies</a> have explored the link between exercise and sleep, and most conclude that certain types of physical activity improve sleep quality and duration. Interestingly, other forms of exercise can decrease sleep quality and prevent us from getting enough rest. The best exercise to improve sleep largely depends on how old you are. For instance, some studies have found that moderate exercise training over the course of several weeks can improve sleep quality and duration for adolescents, whereas vigorous exercise during the same timespan has been shown to decrease sleep duration for some teens. Regular exercise can help healthy adults sleep better. While acute physical activity can have a small effect on sleep quality and duration, regular, moderate exercise can extend sleep duration, improve sleep quality, and decrease sleep onset, or the time it takes to fall asleep.",
infoBoxDreams = "<b>Dreams</b><br> Dreaming is one of the most unique and intriguing aspects of sleep. During a normal nightâ€™s sleep, itâ€™s typical to spend about two hours dreaming. The most intense dreams happen during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, but distinct types of dreams can occur during any part of the sleep cycle.<br><br>Dreams can have imagery that is positive, negative, or outright confusing, likely reflecting a period of immense imagination during sleep. Nevertheless, whether in good or bad dreams, experiences from when youâ€™re awake are frequently incorporated into dream content.<br><br>Experts continue to debate about why we dream, but considerable evidence points to dreams playing a role in facilitating brain functions like memory and emotional processing. Dreams appear to be an important part of normal, healthy sleep. At the same time, though, nightmares can disrupt sleep and even affect a person during their waking hours.",
infoBoxTemperature = "<b>Temperature</b><br> Your body heat peaks late afternoon and then starts to drop in the evening to prepare your body for sleep, kickstarting melatonin production. An ideal bedroom temperature is around 16-18Â°C (60-65Â°F).<br><br>Hot, cold or draughty rooms can seriously impact on your sleep, in particular REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Temperatures over 24Â°C (71Â°F) are likely to cause restlessness, while a cold room of about 12Â°C (53Â°F) will make it difficult to drop off.",
infoBoxElectronics = "<b>Electronic Devices</b><br> Electronic back-lit devices like cell phones, tablets, readers, and computers emit short-wavelength enriched light, also known as blue light. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/longhourstraining/color.html\">Fluorescent and LED lights</a> also emit blue light, which has been shown to reduce or delay the natural production of melatonin in the evening and decrease feelings of sleepiness. Blue light can also reduce the amount of time you spend in slow-wave and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, two stages of the sleep cycle that are vital for cognitive functioning.",
infoBoxLearning = "<b>Learning</b><br>  Multiple hypotheses explain the possible connections between sleep and learning in humans. Research indicates that sleep does more than allow the brain to rest. It may also aid the consolidation of long-term memories.<br><br>REM sleep and slow-wave sleep play different roles in memory consolidation. REM is associated with the consolidation of nondeclarative (implicit) memories. An example of a nondeclarative memory would be a task that we can do without consciously thinking about it, such as riding a bike. Slow-wave, or non-REM (NREM) sleep, is associated with the consolidation of declarative (explicit) memories. These are facts that need to be consciously remembered, such as dates for a history class.",
infoBoxPlants = "<b>Plants</b><br>  The green leaves of plants carry out both photosynthesis (in light) and respiration (all the time). Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide to make sugar and produces oxygen as a byproduct. Respiration uses oxygen to release energy from stored sugar and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct.<br><br>During daytime, photosynthesis is going on faster than respiration, so, normally, plants will produce oxygen during the day (just what your dad could do with). However, at night, only respiration continues, so plants (like other organisms - mice - cats - dogs - people - bacteria) produce carbon dioxide and use up oxygen. This is not true for all plants. Some will produce more oxygen during the night than they consume.",
infoBoxLightSci = "<b>Light</b><br>  Rhythmic variations in ambient illumination impact behaviours such as rest during sleep and activity during wakefulness as well as their underlying biological processes. Rather recently, the availability of artificial light has substantially changed the light environment, especially during evening and night hours. This may increase the risk of developing circadian rhythm sleepâ€“wake disorders (CRSWD), which are often caused by a misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and external lightâ€“dark cycles.",
infoBoxSleepStages = "<b>Sleep Cycle</b><br>  We all know the concept of sleeping: You go to bed in the evening, close your eyes, fall asleep at some point and maybe dream during the night before you awake in the morning. But what happens when you sleep? Simply, itÂ´s a state of body and mind during the sleep cycle when you are less reactive to stimuli and you donÂ´t move. Sleep is orchestrated by the internal circadian clock, which tells you when you need sleep. When you fall asleep, your body alternates between two phases: REM and non-REM sleep. REM stands for rapid eye movement.  First, Non-REM sleep (divided into N1 and N2) occurs and after a certain time transits into slow-wave sleep or deep sleep (N3). During this phase, body temperature drops, the heart rate slows down and the brain uses less energy. Second, REM sleep occurs. It represents a smaller portion of the total sleep time. During this phase the brain waves get faster, dreams occur, the eyes move but you donÂ´t. One sleep cycle (alternation between Rem and non-REM) takes 90 minutes. In a good nights sleep four to six of these cycles occur. Later in the night the REM phases occur more often compared to the beginning of the night. In the following graph you can see a hypnogramm which shows the sleep cycle with all sleep phases. <img id=\"infoBoxImg\" src=\"img/sleep_stages_walker.png\"></img>",
